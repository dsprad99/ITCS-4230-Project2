Objective

How to Play
To go forward, left, down, and right use WASD keys or arrow keys.
Helpful Tips
Utilize power ups throughout the game to help give you a short burst in increase in speed and also make sure to avoid the blue pits in order to not slow you down and force you to go back to the previous checkpoint. There is realistic acceleration, friction, and momentum in the game and thus if you are going too fast around a turn you can spin out.
