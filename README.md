# Circuit Racers -- Team Neon
## Objective
Win the race against other “Bits” to help save the system's security and stop the malware from spreading. Each race consists of 3 laps, and coming in first on the 3rd lap means you "Win" the race.

## How to Play (can also use arrow keys)
A/D: Turn Left/Right respectively, W/S, Accelerate Forward/Backward respectively.

## Helpful Tips
Utilize power ups throughout the game to help give you a short burst in increase in speed and also make sure to avoid the blue pits in order to not slow you down and force you to go back to the previous checkpoint. There is realistic acceleration, friction, and momentum in the game and thus if you are going too fast around a turn you can spin out.
